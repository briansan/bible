            -- the crowd-sourced edition --
           demo at http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1

  - Background
  
    I was wondering what it would be like to have an api
    for the Holy Bible. Enter, bible.

  - Introduction
  
    bible is an application that can store the contents of any
    written content. In this case, we are using the Holy Bible
    to record its contents. Interestingly, if this software 
    is used for any other collection of literature, we could 
    run into some serious intellectual property issues. 

    As of now, bible is implemented as a standalone api server.
    You can check out a demo at http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1

    Hopefully in the next few weeks, I'll get a client-side up
    and running so that all computers can use this app easily,
    but for now, it would be best if you had a basic understanding
    of the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

    Here are some resources on HTTP if you are interested:

    Official Standard: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html
    TODO: create my own guided explanation on http 

  - Getting Started

    Try to visit these links:
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/lang
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/version
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/book
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/NIV/Matt/1
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/NIV/Matt/1/1
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/NIV/Matt/1/1/5

    Once you've visited these pages, you should have a good
    idea of what is going on here.

  - For Developers

    You can perform all the HTTP methods (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)
    at these locations (Except for the last one as batch modifying
    is not yet supported). Perhaps I should generate some more
    comphrensive documentation on the links, but here are the basics...

    Astericks (*) denote the key used to uniquely identify an entity

    /lang: a means of communication
      * 'abbr': abbreviation (en)
      - 'name': full name (English)

    /version: an instance of translation
      - 'lang': abbreviation of language used (en)
      * 'abbr': abbreviation (NIV)
      - 'name': full name (New Internation Version)

    /book: a collection of chapters
      - 'lang': abbreviation of language used (en)
      * 'abbr': abbreviation (Matt)
      - 'name': full name (Matthew)
      - 'numch': number of chapters in the book

    Perhaps more interesting is the definition of a verse within the Bible

    Verse: an indexed passage in the chapter of a book
      - 'number': index
      - 'text': contents
      
      To specify the chapter, provide the data to the path that represents the chapter
      /<version.abbr>/<book.abbr>/<chapter.number> (/NIV/Matt/1)
      
  - Further Work

    This is really just the beginning. I wish to develop a client-side piece 
    to this app for a better user-interface. 
    Right now, it's only a programmer-interface.

  - Disclaimer

    This app itself is called bible due to its abstract nature in representing
    any form of written work. In no way do I intend to demonstrate any level 
    of disrepect to the Holy Bible through the undercased title of this software. 
    It is simply my convention for naming apps.
