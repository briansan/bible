            -- the crowd-sourced edition --
           demo at http://bible.breadtech.com

  - Background
  
    I was wondering what it would be like to have an api
    for the Holy Bible. Enter, bible.

  - Introduction
  
    As of now, bible is implemented as a standalone api server.
    You can check out a demo at http://bible.breadtech.com.
    
  - Getting Started

    Try to visit these links:
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/lang
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/version
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/book
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/niv/matt/1
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/niv/matt/1/1
    http://bible.breadtech.com/api/v1/niv/matt/1/1/5

    Once you've visited these pages, you should have a good
    idea of what is going on here.

  - For Developers

    You can perform all the HTTP methods (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)
    at these locations (Except for the last one as batch modifying
    is not yet supported). Perhaps I should generate some more
    comphrensive documentation on the links, but here are the basics...

    Astericks (*) denote the key used to uniquely identify an entity

    /lang: a means of communication
      * 'abbr': abbreviation (en)
      - 'name': full name (English)

    /version: an instance of translation
      - 'lang': abbreviation of language used (en)
      * 'abbr': abbreviation (NIV)
      - 'name': full name (New Internation Version)

    /book: a collection of chapters
      - 'lang': abbreviation of language used (en)
      * 'abbr': abbreviation (Matt)
      - 'name': full name (Matthew)

    Perhaps more interesting is the definition of a verse within the Bible

    Verse: an indexed passage in the chapter of a book
      - 'number': index
      - 'text': contents
      
      To specify the chapter, you want to provide the data to the path that represents the chapter
      /<version.abbr>/<book.abbr>/<chapter.number> (/NIV/Matt/1)
      
  - Further Work

    This is really just the beginning. I wish to develop a client-side piece 
    to this app for a better user-interface. Right now, it's only a programmer-interface.
